        <p>
            LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball
             player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed 
             "King James", he is widely considered one of the greatest players ever and is often compared 
             to Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player of all time.James has won four NBA 
             championships, four NBA MVP awards, four NBA Finals MVP awards, three
              All-Star MVP awards, and two Olympic gold medals. James has scored the most points in the playoffs, 
              the most career points (playoffs and regular seasons combined),the second most regular seasons points, and has the seventh most career assists. He has been selected an NBA All-Star 18 times, to the All-NBA Team a record 18 times, and to the NBA All-Defensive First Team five times. He has competed in ten NBA Finals, the third most all time, including eight consecutively between 2011 and 2018. In 2021, James was selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team,and in 2022 became the first player in NBA history to accumulate 10,000 or more career points, rebounds, and assists.
        </p>

    <p>James played basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, and 
        was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar. A prep-to-pro, he was selected
         by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA 
         Rookie of the Year, he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, winning
          the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010.After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James 
          left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat; this was announced in the television special
           The Decision and is among the most controversial free-agent decisions in sports history.</p>

    <p> James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these
         years, he also earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 
         2014, James opted out of his contract to re-sign with the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to 
         victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering 
         the team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse.In 2018, James exercised his 
         contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020
          NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP.James is also the first player in
           NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player.
        </p>
        
        <p>Off the court, James has accumulated more wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. 
        He has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning two Sports Emmy Awards as an 
        executive producer), and television commercials. He has won 19 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday
         Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). James has been 
         a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, 
         which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza/community center, 
         and medical center in Akron.

    <h2> Early Life </h2>
    <p>
        James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was 16 at the 
        time of his birth.His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not
         involved in his life. When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they 
         moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find
          steady work. Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria 
          allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced
           James to basketball when he was nine years old.
    </p>
    <p>
        James began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.
         He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.
          The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, 
          Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.: The group dubbed themselves the "Fab Four" and 
          promised each other that they would attend high school together.In a move that stirred
           local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, a private Catholic 
           school with predominantly white students.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2> Highschool Career </h2>
    <p> 
        As a 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) tall freshman, James averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent–St. Mary varsity basketball team. The Fighting Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated. As a sophomore, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds, along with 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game. For some home games during the season, St. Vincent–St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play. The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions. For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.
    </p> 
    <p>
        In 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in Slam 
        magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to 6 feet 7 inches 
        (2.01 m), as "[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now". During the
         season, James also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school 
         basketball underclassman to do so. With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 
         3.3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA
          First Team, and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of 
          the Year.St. Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a
           loss in the Division II championship game.Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned
            for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft.
             During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that 
             resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.

            <h2> Professional Career</h2>
            <p>
                Cleveland Cavaliers (2003–2010)
2003–2004: Rookie of the Year
James was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.In his first regular season game, he scored 25 points against the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.At the conclusion of the 2003–04 season, he became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game, he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie.Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[44]

2004–2008: Rise to superstardom
In the 2004–05 season, James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, and Denver Nuggets coach George Karl told Sports Illustrated: "It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule." On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record. With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team. Despite a 30–20 record to start the year,the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42–40.

            <h2>National Team Career</h2>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/LeBron_James_at_the_2022_NBA_All-Star_Game.jpg/175px-LeBron_James_at_the_2022_NBA_All-Star_Game.jpg">
             <p> James made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece.[311] He spent the Games mostly on the bench,[312] 
                averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games.[311] Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding active NBA players to their lineup.[313] James felt his limited playing time was a "lowlight" and believed he was not given "a fair opportunity to play";[312] 
                his attitude during the Olympics was described as "disrespectful" by columnist Adrian Wojnarowski.[314]

                At the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain.The team finished the tournament with an 8–1 record, winning another bronze medal.
                James's behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.
             </p>   
            <p>    
                 Before naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice.
                At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier.Team USA went 10–0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.
                James credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: "I don't think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now." At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000. 
                In the final game, James turned in 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists against Spain.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                James did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England. He became the leader of the team, with Bryant, who would soon be 34, stepping back.James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed.
                During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists. 
                Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game.James contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history.He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year.Afterwards, Krzyzewski said: "[James] is the best player, 
                he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now."</p>
            </p>

            <h2>Player Profile</h2>
            <p> Standing 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) tall and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg),James has played the majority of his career at the small forward and power forward positions,but he has also been deployed at the other positions when necessary.His playing style, which is athletic and versatile,has drawn comparisons to Basketball Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan. Through the 2021–22 season, James's career averages are 27.1 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.6 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game.Throughout the 2010s, he was usually ranked as the best player in the NBA each season by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.</p>
            <p>
                As an 18-year-old rookie, James led the Cavaliers in scoring.He holds numerous "youngest to" distinctions,including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points. During his first stint in Cleveland, he was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented, he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball. His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because he was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones. These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets. Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game. Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For most of his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team.His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history.By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention he garners from opposing defenses,James creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists.He executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic. His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.Early in James's career, he was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games;however, as his career progressed, James's clutch performance was viewed more favorably.
