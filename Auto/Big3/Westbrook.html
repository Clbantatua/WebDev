    <h2> Early Life </h2>
    <p>
        Westbrook was born in Long Beach, California, to Russell Westbrook Jr. and Shannon Horton.
         He has a younger brother named Raynard. Growing up in Hawthorne, Westbrook and his best friend Khelcey 
         Barrs III had hopes of going to UCLA and playing together. At age 16, Barrs was already known to have
          excellent basketball skills and received college scholarship offers.


        In May 2004, Barrs died from an enlarged heart during a pick-up game.
         After Barrs' death, Westbrook seemed even more determined to excel in
          honor of his best friend's memory.

    <h2> Highschool Career </h2>
    <p> 
        Westbrook entered Leuzinger High School as a point guard who stood only 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m) tall 
        and weighed only 140 pounds (64 kg), although he did have large (size 14) feet. He did not start on his 
        school's varsity team until his junior year,[13] and did not receive his first college recruiting letter
         until the summer before his senior year. Westbrook grew to his adult height of 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) that same summer.
    </p> 
    <p>
        During his senior year, Westbrook averaged 25.1 points, 8.7 rebounds, 3.1 steals, and 2.3 assists 
        and helped lead them to a 25–4 record. That same season, he recorded 14 double-doubles, scored 30
         or more points on eight separate occasions, and registered a career-best 51 points at Carson on 
         January 6, 2006. Westbrook initially did not attract much attention from top college basketball
          programs. After his height increased, contributing to him averaging more than 25 points per game
           and becoming a solid college basketball prospect, coach Ben Howland recruited him to play for the
            UCLA Bruins.Westbrook declined other offers while waiting for the Bruins' Jordan Farmar to leave 
            early for the NBA and free up a scholarship.

        Westbrook wore number 0 throughout his career at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
        As a freshman in 2006–07, he played as a backup to Darren Collison and was primarily used as
         a defender and energy player off the bench. Westbrook averaged 3.4 points, 0.8 rebounds, and 
         0.7 assists on the year. During the offseason, he trained extensively, both in the weight room
          and in the gym, where he faced NBA veterans who visited Los Angeles.The next season, Collison was 
          injured and Westbrook was named the starter. He finished the season averaging 12.7 points, 3.9
           rebounds, 4.7 assists and 1.6 steals. At the end of the year, he was named All-Pac-10 Third Team
            and won the Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year.</p>
            <p>
                UCLA advanced to the Final Four during each of Westbrook's seasons with the team. In 2007, 
                they lost to eventual national champion Florida, 76–66 and in 2008, they lost 78–63
                 to Memphis. After two years at UCLA, Westbrook decided to forgo his final two years 
                 and enter the 2008 NBA draft.[ He stayed in school and finished the quarter, a rarity 
                 for high draft picks declaring early for the draft.

                On a team without a single member from its 2008 Olympic gold-medal team, Westbrook was 
                considered a star on the team.[205] The 2010 team relied heavily on a small lineup,and 
                Westbrook finished in the top five on the team in minutes per game, and top three in points 
                and assists per game. Team USA went 9–0 to win its first World Championship since 1994.
